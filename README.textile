.h1 NAME

lddsafe -- Safely print shared library dependencies (similar to ldd)

.h1 DESCRIPTION

@lddsafe@ is a shell script written for Linux distributions (tested under Slackware Linux) that prints shared library dependencies for executable files and shared libraries, similar to @ldd@. However, it uses @objdump@ instead of loading the program, hence avoiding the security problems of @ldd@.

.h1 REQUIREMENTS

The most notable requirement of @lddsafe@ is that it needs @bash@ version 4 or later.

.h1 BUG REPORTS

Please, do not hesitate to point out possible improvements and ways to make the script work on systems which it currently may not work.
